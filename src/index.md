### About me
*~ ♂️ Male | INFJ-T | 18yr (2020) | Sri Lanka | Different ~*<br>
My name is *Imesh Chamara* (eemesh chamara). I had my first computer at 13 and I wrote my first code after six month. after that coding became my hobby. I code stuff all day just for fun. I started coding with a microcontroller then I stared coding windows apps. with the time, I become a *Full Stack Developer*. that means, I can make apps for Windows and Linux. I can make websites, and web servers. I also tried out simple AI projects, but they all just failed. I didn't learn these in proper way so, I'm not a smart pro developer. I don't have many things to write, because still haven't accomplish much things in my life.

+ Things I Like: *Programming, J-POP, Japan.*
+ Things I Don't Like: *Alcohol, Drugs, Violence, Travelings.*
+ Things I'm Not Interested: *Sports, Vehicles, new Tech stuff(Phones, Tabs, etc.)*
