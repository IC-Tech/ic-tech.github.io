# SSAS
Project `SSAS` is not my own project. few friends asked me to code it. The name of the project was so long and I short it to *SSAS*. It was some kind of smart home device. simply "they build it, I code it". so there was a device, webserver and website me to code. That was the first time I had to deal with "live data processing". yes, I messed up. things weren't go as I planned. but I was able to coverup with lots of temporary fix.
