### Description
Kotori is an assistant bot made by me (Imesh Chamara). project kotori is different than all the project I have created because it's not just a project, it's a concept. I got that concept by Iron-man, I wanted my own Jarvis, I wanted my own assistant program. the first versions of kotori, she got little AI system but I couldn't train the database properly and now she looks like a command bot. she got lots of features and I still adding more.

### Plans  
I need to train the AI database and make her more human friendly.
I also have a plan to made her voice controllable (like google assistant).<br>
(and more private plans.)
