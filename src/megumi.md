### Description
Megumi bot was open-source and totally free to use. She was specially made for Roleplay but she also had other commands too. she contained more than 59 commands. I had to shutdown the project because I didn't had enough resources to continue (money issues). before I shutdown, she had ~2000 users in ~10 servers. Personally, I really liked the project and it was fun to work on that.
