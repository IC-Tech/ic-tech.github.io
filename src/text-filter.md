# text-filter
While I were working on an AI project, I realized that my resources contain bad words. I didn't want to process with those bad words, so I build a filter system to remove them. I thought it would be helpful to others, so I post it public. The words are only for English and I only posted the simplest version of the words. There are few other ways to bad words appear on something. Those who use the database should figure that out.  
*I just collect them from random webpages, I do not even know if some words are bad or not.*
