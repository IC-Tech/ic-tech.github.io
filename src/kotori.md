### Description
Kotori is an assistant bot made by me (Imesh Chamara). project kotori is little different from all other projects I have created, because it's not just a project, it's a concept. I got that concept by Iron-man, I wanted my own Jarvis, I wanted my own assistant program. the first versions of kotori, she got little AI system but I couldn't train the database properly and after removing it, she started to look like a command bot. she got lots of features and I still adding more. after few incidents I lost some resources and the project got messed up, but I still working on this. its still little too far to achieve my goal.

### Plans  
I need to train the AI database and make her more human friendly.
I also have a plan to made her voice controllable (like google assistant).<br>
(and more private plans.)
